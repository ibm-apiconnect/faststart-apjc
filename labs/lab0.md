## Objective 
In the following lab, you will learn:

+ How to install Node.js on to your machine
+ How to enable API Connect on your Bluemix account
+ How to install the APIC Developer Toolkit

## Case Study used in this tutorial
In this tutorial, you will be starting from scratch to set up your development environment on your local machine.

## Before you begin
For this lab, you will be starting with your local image and installing node.js and the developer toolkit.  After that, if you do not already have a Bluemix account, you will be creating one for you and enabling the API Connect Essentials service on your account. The instructions you will follow will vary by the host operating system you are using. The three host OS's supported by this are `Windows`, `Linux - Intel` and `Linux - Mac`.  Skip to the section for your appropriate operating system.

## Step by Step Lab Instructions

### 0.1 - Install Node.js

#### 0.1a - Windows

1.  If you don't have node already installed on your machine, then please proceed.  Otherwise, move on to section 0.2 (Setup your Bluemix account).  

1.  Installing Node on Windows based machines (Tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10):
	
1.  The following are pre-requisites that need to be installed before installing node:

    1.  Install Python
	
        1.  version 2.7 is required. You can download it here:

            ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot/raw/gh-pages/images/lab1/3.png)

1.  Install Node.js

    1.  Go to this link to install Node:
    
        [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

    1.  Select the "LTS version - Recommended for most users".  Version at the top should depict v4.5 - includes npm 2.15.9.

        ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot/raw/gh-pages/images/lab1/4.png)

    1.  Select the Windows Installer .msi binary and then follow the prompts to install on your machine.
	
    1.  Before moving on, You will need to update your version of `npm` to version `3.8.10`
	
    1.  To do so, perform the following steps:
	
    1.  Click on `Start` and then in the search window type in `Powershell`.  Right click on `Windows PowerShell` and then select `Run as Administrator`

        ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot/raw/gh-pages/images/lab1/4a.png)

    1.  Execute these commands in Powershell

        ```bash
        Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force
        npm install -g npm-windows-upgrade
        npm-windows-upgrade
        ```
        
    1.  Select the `3.10.8` version of npm.  This is the recommended version to run with. Close the Powershell.

1.  Install API Connect on to your machine by starting up a command line window as Administrator and issue this command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g apiconnect --no-optional --ignore-scripts
    ```

1.  Once complete start up a new terminal window and enter in `apic -v`.

    If it returns the version of the platform, and not an error message, then the toolkit should then be properly installed.

1.  You are now ready to move on to section 0.2.

#### 0.1b - Linux

1.  Install the essentials to run node.js:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev curl git-core
    ```

1.  Install Node Version Manager aka "nvm" by issuing this command here:

    ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.2/install.sh | bash
    ```

    {% include note.html content="
        When you install `nvm` it will also install `npm` which is the node package manager used to install node.js based software modules, including the API Connect Developer Toolkit.
    " %}

1.  Close and restart your terminal as indicated in the terminal window or run this command `source ~/.profile`.

1.  Run this command to confirm your version `nvm --version`

1.  This command will provide documentation on nvm if you wish to learn more about it `nvm help`.  NVM is exceptionally useful as it will allow you to support multiple installations of node.js on your machine, and select the version you want to use.  For our lab today, we only need the one version as indicated in the steps below.

1.  To check and see which versions of node are available, issue this command `nvm ls-remote`.  It will provide a very long list.  For API Connect, we will use a specific version of node.  That is version 4.5.0

1.  To install node 4.5.0 issue this command `nvm install 4.5.0`

    ```bash
    student@ubuntu:~$ nvm install 4.5.0
    Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.4.7/node-v4.5.0-linux-x64.tar.xz...
    Now using node v4.5.0 (npm v2.15.9)
    ```

1.  Install API Connect by issuing this command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g apiconnect
    ```

    It will take several minutes to complete.

1.  Once complete start up a new terminal window and enter in `apic -v`.

    If it returns the version of the platform, and not an error message, then the toolkit should then be properly installed.

1.  You are now ready to move on to section 0.2.

#### 0.1c - Mac OS

1.  Check to see if node is already installed.

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

1.  Check the version, if it is version 4.5.0 then you can move on to section 1.1 - Create your Bluemix account. However if you would prefer to uninstall and reinstall node using Node Version Manager or if node was not found then please continue.

1.  Remove any existing versions of node. You will only need to complete these steps if node currently exists. To remove node completely from your Mac OSX environment run each of the following commands. Open a terminal session and type each of the commands below individually. 
 
    ```bash
    sudo rm /usr/local/bin/npm
    sudo rm /usr/local/share/man/man1/node.1
    sudo rm /usr/local/lib/dtrace/node.d
    sudo rm -rf ~/.npm
    sudo rm -rf ~/.node-gyp
    sudo rm /opt/local/bin/node
    sudo rm /opt/local/include/node
    sudo rm -rf /opt/local/lib/node_modules
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/include/node/
    ```

1.  Install Xcode Command Line Tools. Open a terminal and type

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

1.  This will open a dialog informing you that the command line developer tools are required for install. Press the Install button.

    ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot/raw/gh-pages/images/lab1/mac-xcode-tools-install-complete.png)

1.  Next install git. You may already have a version, but if you want to have the latest version you will need to download the install from https://git-scm.com/download/mac

1.  Once on the install page the download should start immediately. However if it does not start immediately, click the "click here to download manually" link.

    ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot/raw/gh-pages/images/lab1/mac-git-install-download.png)

1.  Once the download has completed, you should have a file named similar to git-2.8.1-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg. Double-click to unpack the disk image.

1.  Once the disk image is unpacked and open, double-click the git-2.8.1-intel-universal-mavericks.pkg file. Note that if you downloaded a different version the file name will be reflected accordingly.

    ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot/raw/gh-pages/images/lab1/mac-git-install-package.png)

1.  You may get a dialog box with a message stating that the file can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. Click the OK button. Open your System Preferences and select the Security & Privacy component. In the section called "Allow apps downloaded from:" you will notice a message that states '"git-2.8.1-..ericks.pkg" was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer.', press the Open Anyway button. This will open the installer for git.

    ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot/raw/gh-pages/images/lab1/mac-git-install-start.png)

1.  Follow the wizard to install. The installation is complete when you see a message stating that the installation was successful.
  
1.  Install Node Version Manager aka "nvm" by opening a terminal session and typing the following commands:

    ```bash
    git clone git://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm
    printf "\n\n# NVM\nif [ -s ~/.nvm/nvm.sh ]; then\n\tNVM_DIR=~/.nvm\n\tsource ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\nfi" >> ~/.bashrc
    NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
    source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    nvm install 4.5.0
    nvm alias default node
    nvm use node
    ```

    > **Note:** You may want to update your .bash file so you do not have to source the shell script every time. To do that, add the following to your .profile located in your user home directory:
    > 
    > ```bash
    > export NVM_PATH=~/.nvm
    > source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    > ```

1.  Install API Connect by issuing the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g apiconnect
    ```

    It will take several minutes to complete.

1.  Once complete start up a new terminal window and enter in `apic -v`.

    If it returns the version of the platform, and not an error message, then the toolkit should then be properly installed.

1.  You are now ready to move on to section 0.2.
