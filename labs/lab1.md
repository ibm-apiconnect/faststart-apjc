---

## Objective 
The developer portal section of this lab is split into 3 parts, which must be followed in order since each part builds upon the previous part. From a high level, the 3 parts are:
  
1.	Set up API Connect (lab 0 in the PoT)
2.	Perform the basic developer portal customisation lab (Part 1.1 in this lab) 
3.	Perform the advanced developer portal customisation lab (Part 1.2 in this lab) 

## Before you begin
Lab 0 - Setup IBM API Connect must be completed before this lab can be performed. 

## Step by Step Lab Instructions

### **1.1	- Basic Developer Portal Customisation**

In this section, you will leverage a custom prebuilt theme. A theme file is packaged as a zip file that contains a set of predefined files. The theme zip file is what is loaded into the developer portal. The best method for creating a custom theme is to obtain an existing custom theme, rename it and change the files as explained in the table below to meet your customization needs.

|Filename|Description|
|--------|-----------|  
|`overrides.css`|This style sheet overrides the fonts, colors and other defaults from the inherited base IBM API Connect theme. The name of this css file is specified in the theme.info file.|
|`screenshot.png`|The file contains a screenshot of the home page for the custom theme and is used in the appearance settings so you can easily find the theme you want to enable and set as the default theme. When you are finishing completing the edits to the overrides.css and have set up the welcome banner to your satisfaction, you should take a screen shot of the developer portal home page and capture it with Snagit or some other screen capture tool and place the file in the top level directory of the theme file. The name of this screenshot file is specified in the theme.info file.|
|`templete.php`|The template.php file contains your sub-theme's functions to manipulate Drupal's default markup. It is one of the most useful files when creating or modifying Drupal themes. With this file you can modify any theme hooks variables or add your own variables, using preprocess or process functions. Override any theme function: that is, replace a module's default theme function with one you write. Call hook alter functions, which allow you to alter various parts of Drupal's internals, including the render elements in forms. See <http://api.drupal.org> for more information about these functions.| 
|`thinkibm_connect_theme.info`|The .info file is a static text file for defining and configuring a theme. Each line in the.info file is a key-value pair with the key on the left and the value on the right, with an "equals sign" between them (e.g. name = my_theme). The info file naming conventions needs to have the theme name specified as part of the filename. The project key in the .info file contains the name of the theme.|
|`theme-settings.php`|Drupal themes get a number of configurable settings options for free. For example, most provide toggle switches for the search box, site slogans, user pictures, and so on. Similarly, most provide file uploading widgets to add a custom logo or favicon. These settings are easy: Drupal will add them to the theme's configuration page by default, so it takes no extra work. We want to create our own custom setting, however; one that adds a hidden field that contains the current release information to the Theme configuration form. To do that, we'll need to add a new file to the theme: `theme-settings.php`. The function name specified within this file needs to be prefixed with the theme name: `thinkibm_connect_theme`.|
|`thinkibm_welcome_banner.png`|This file provides the image that shows up in the welcome banner. Although the welcome banner does not need to be part of the theme zip file contents, it is useful to place the welcome banner with other theme files.|
|`favicon.ico`|In web development, you can provide a small logo for your site that appears near the address bar and in the bookmarks folder in a visitor's browser. This logo is called the favicon. Drupal provides a default one, which is the recognizable water drop logo. Using the Drupal logo as the favicon is fine but if you really want to make your site stand out, you should provide your own. Favicon files are in the .ico format and are extremely small in dimensions. The default Drupal favicon is 32 pixels high by 32 pixels wide, many browsers use a 16 x 16 pixel version that can be included in the same file. This is because the favicon is only an icon that shows up in the address bar and favorites (bookmarks) list and typically there is not a lot of room there. Any favicon that you create should be just as small.|

    ![](https://ibm-apiconnect.github.io/faststart/images/europe2017/lab1/5.png)
 
8.	Save the configuration 

9.	You will notice that you will not be able to see any changes. This is because the color scheme of the slogan is set to white text on the white background. 




### **Colour Schemes and Custom CSS**
Here we are going to add custom CSS to our theme. For this we are going to use the ‘Custom CSS’ extension in the developer portal. Note the ‘Custom CSS’ extension is designed to make small CSS changes in the case of emergencies in production. However, the ‘Custom CSS’ extension is also useful to quickly make CSS changes at development time when you are building the look and feel of a developer portal. It saves the need to re-upload the theme every time a new CSS change is made throughout development. Once you are happy with the CSS and it is stable, it should be moved from the ‘Custom CSS’ extension and placed inside the overrides.css file inside the theme itself. 

1.	To activate the ‘Custom CSS’ extension go to Appearance > Setting > thinkibm_connect > Extensions > Check box ‘Custom CSS’.

    ![](https://ibm-apiconnect.github.io/faststart/images/europe2017/lab1/6.png)
      
2.	Save the changes by clicking ‘Save Configuration’ at the bottom of the page. 
3.	Now if you go to Appearance > Setting > thinkibm_connect then scroll down to the menu at the bottom (extensions), there will be a new menu tab called ‘Custom CSS’. In here, any custom CSS declarations can be set. 
4.	Inside the custom CSS editor area, copy the flowing 2 CSS declarations:
             
             /*  CSS for changing the site slogan: */
                h2#site-slogan {
                  padding-top: 1.9em;
                  font-size: 2em !important;
                  color: #444849;

                }
                /* CSS for changing the logo padding: */
                img.site-logo {
                  height: 95px;
                  padding-top: 14px;
                }
		
			/* Adjusts the menu bar: */
			#page
			{
			   padding-top: 100px;
			}

    ![](https://ibm-apiconnect.github.io/faststart/images/europe2017/lab1/7.png)

5.	Now scroll to the bottom of the page and hit ‘Save Configuration’. 
6.	Scroll to the top and hit the X to close the Appearance menu and view the changes you have made. 

    ![](https://ibm-apiconnect.github.io/faststart/images/europe2017/lab1/8.png)

7.  After returning to the Home Page of your Developer Portal, it should look like the image below. 

     ![](https://ibm-apiconnect.github.io/faststart/images/europe2017/lab1/theme-uploaded-final.png)
